## report writing

IT SUCKS!!! get used to it

- reports must be delivered a week after the engagement ends
- report should be both executive-level and technical
- recommendations for execs+technical staff need to be clear, specific, and useful.
- don't just paste raw `nmap` output lol.

- write a shitty report! just Do It.
- you will get better. embrace the suck at report writing.

### debrief

- walks your clients thru report
- both non-technical and technical
- talk to the CEO one way, talk to the network engi,
- it depends. u may get a mixed crowd.
- you need to be able to explain things at a high level and a technical level.

...the debrief is useful because it presents the client an opportunity to connect with
the pentester and ask them clarifying questions, before a final report is released.
