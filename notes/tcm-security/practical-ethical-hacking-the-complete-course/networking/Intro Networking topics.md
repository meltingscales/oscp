## quiz

1. take notes during the pentest.
2. take notes during the assessment.
3. take notes during the CTFs.

..

it's important to take good notes becuauauaause:
1. you learn stuff from them (memorization and doing are NOT the same thing!!!)
2. you need data to write a full report - what happens if you forgot the reason that your payload succeeded? what happens if you forget what Active Directory permission let you escalate? etc etc.
3. recordkeeping: what happens if you need to, for auditing or legal purposes, prove what sort of data you sent to a system? prove that you did/didn't break something, etc...
