..........WOW!!!! packets. ports. wowie!!


## common ports and protocols

...just since I don't memorize all of these,

- tcp
	- 21/ftp
	- 22/ssh
	- 23/telnet
	- 53/dns
	- 80/http
	- 443/https
	- 110/pop3
	- 139+445/smb
	- 143/imap
- udp
	- 53/dns
	- 67,68/dhcp
	- 69/tftp
	- 161/snmp

smtp, pop3, imap are all mail related (mailpup...good album)

dns is...yeeee haw!!! 🤠
(literally just turns a domain into IP)

SMB is a...tasty tasty source of vulnerabilities. binary protocol that windows uses to be extremely vulnerable. yum!!!!!!
