alex olson "The BEST Notetaking Apps Ranked"

I really like the Notion app (presenter).

ex of Notion layout:

- Pentest A
  - Pre-compromise
    - LLMNR Poisoning
      (some code)
    - SMB Relay
      (some code)
    - IPv6 attacks
  - Hack Cracking
  - Post-Compromise

make sure you take good notes!!! !! !

literally just pick a notebook.

notion is good
joplin is good
obsidian is good.

BY THE WAY, Obsidian can handle copy-pasted .png files into .md files directly. :3

greenshot lets you put borders on images.
(probably can do this w/ imagemagick or ffmpeg)

don't use too much black in reports, invert colors if u can.
or just like. use GIMP or imagemagick or ffmpeg

don't blur stuff. just delete it with BLACK/WHITE/RED pixels. silly. blurring can be deblurred.

(notion supports copy-paste images)
