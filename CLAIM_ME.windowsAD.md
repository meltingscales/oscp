For Windows AD (net user, net group, domain enumeration):
Easy boxes:

Active - Classic AD box, great for learning basic AD enumeration
Forest - Excellent for AD basics and Kerberos attacks
Support - Good for AD enumeration techniques

Medium boxes:

Intelligence - Strong AD enumeration and exploitation practice
Cascade - Great for AD enumeration and credential hunting
Monteverde - Good AD enumeration practice
Sauna - Excellent for AS-REP roasting and basic AD attacks

Hard boxes:

Blackfield - Advanced AD techniques

For Pivoting (Chisel/Ligolo-ng):
While the list doesn't specifically indicate which boxes require pivoting tools, these are known to involve port forwarding/tunneling:
Medium boxes:

Intelligence - Often requires pivoting techniques
Pivotapi (Insane) - The name suggests heavy pivoting practice

More challenging:

Cascade, Monteverde, Nest - These often involve lateral movement

My recommendation for OSCP prep:
Start with Forest and Active for foundational AD knowledge, then move to Sauna and Intelligence. For pivoting specifically, you might want to search HackTheBox forums or walkthroughs to confirm which boxes specifically require Chisel or Ligolo-ng, as the list doesn't explicitly mark pivoting requirements.
