<h1 align="center">Tj's Null list in Order with Difficulty and Alphabetical.</h1>


<h2><p align="center"> Purpose </p></h2>
The purpose of this list is because I wanted an organized list to keep it neat and in order. I wanted to color code it to know what kind of machine it was. It is in no way considered more useful or worse or even needed.<br><br>


<h2><p align="center"> Disclaimer </p></h2>
This is not my list. I mereley modified to fit "my" needs.<br>
These rankings are not absolute. They are ranked based off the registered users on https://www.hackthebox.com/ who have successfully captured a user or root flag and rated the difficulty of capturing that user or root flag. Example a veteran user may have scored the machine easy but a beginner user may have scored that same machine hard. This is based off https://www.hackthebox.com/ ranking system alone.<br>
The pdf file should be the main list. This way you can track your progress.<br>
Let me know what rating you gave the machine ðŸ˜„
